Dear Mr. Fraipont,

could you please contact us or give us a adresse where we can meet and talk about the RSConnect App?
We are two students working on research semester and try to connect RS with TIA und MES4.
My e-mail adress is: kunertke@hs-pforzheim.de

This would really help us to proceed in this project.

Sincerely

Kevin Kunert
